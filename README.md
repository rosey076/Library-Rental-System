### Overview

The Library Rental System is a console-based application that allows users to manage book rentals in a library. The system supports three types of books (Children's Books, Computer Books, Novels) and two groups of people (Teachers and Students).

### Input Files

Before running the program, you need to prepare two input files: `books.txt` and `persons.txt`.

1. **books.txt** - This file contains information about the books available in the library. Each line in the file represents a book and has the following format:
   ```
   book_code book_title attribute available_copies rented_copies
   ```
   - `book_code`: Unique identifier for the book (e.g., 1001 for Children's Books, 2001 for Computer Books, 3001 for Novels).
   - `book_title`: Title of the book (use underscores `_` instead of spaces).
   - `attribute`: Age (for Children's Books), Publisher (for Computer Books), or Publish Date (for Novels).
   - `available_copies`: Number of copies available for rent.
   - `rented_copies`: Number of copies currently rented out.

   Example:
   ```
   1001 Harry_Potter 8 5 2
   2001 Introduction_to_Algorithms MIT_Press 10 3
   3001 The_Great_Gatsby 1925 7 1
   ```

2. **persons.txt** - This file contains information about the persons (Teachers and Students) who rent books. Each line in the file represents a person and has the following format:
   ```
   person_id person_name number_of_books_rented book_code1 book_code2 (for students)
   person_id person_name number_of_books_rented book_code1 book_code2 book_code3 (for teachers)
   ```
   - `person_id`: Unique identifier for the person (1-100 for Teachers, 101-300 for Students).
   - `person_name`: Name of the person (use underscores `_` instead of spaces).
   - `number_of_books_rented`: Number of books currently rented by the person.
   - `book_code1`, `book_code2`, `book_code3`: Codes of the books rented by the person (up to 2 for Students, up to 3 for Teachers).

   Example:
   ```
   1 Alice 3 1001 2001 3001
   101 Bob 2 1001 2001
   ```
